                <p>This website plays a major role in my career. I rectify all of my doubts and questions from this website. 
                    This is a vast community of people who were in different fields proceeding different type of jobs. 
                    So that there is always someone at least one who can solve our problems and doubts.
                    And also we can give advice and suggestions to others too, who ask for help. 
                    This a great gift to me as a student.</p>

                    This website is a great opportunity for the one who owns one or more dogs and finds difficult to take care of it 
                    during their jobs and weekends. This website connects dog sitters and dog walkers to the owners so that they can 
                    easily access to others who are interested in and also a big space for the job seekers and pet lovers.

                    Trello is a good option for the one who is busy with his or her jobs, 
                    dating, studies, outings, partying, family, friends, and a lot of assignments and other stuff which
                    make them forget to do things. This is a great opportunity for these type of peoples because we all are 
                    included in this category, it helps to organize things and sort things like pending – doing – done. 
                    And also can make different boards for each task. Can label things, can make a checklist and due dates as well. 
                    The major attraction is more than one person can access the boars if they are allowed so that they can organize things together.
